# Skual frontend server

##Â Introduction

Skual is a Database management system that brings a fresh air to what's already in place.
It aims to optimize the time spent managing your database.

The Skual frontend is build using standard HTML/JS/CSS features and some libraries as listed below :

 * jQuery
 * Require JS
 * CodeMirror

It aims is to be completely independant of the backend, allowing it to be used with any backend, written in any language, and for any database server.
So far, there is only one backend server, written in Python and Flask, and dedicated to MySQL, but you can fork it or build your own, for the database server you want.

Just follow the API urls (They will be published once the backend server will have the basics running.)
